Dave	4	 This is too hard!
Dave	15	I'd better head back to the hardware store.
Dave	13	 This dang thang just ain't enough for the major floodage I get here.
Dave	14	" At this point, I just want to leave this house."
Dave	16	 I should call the realtor for the house up on the hill.

Dave	31	 Are you kidding me?!
Dave	33	That's it.
Dave	60	 I'm done.
Dave	92	 I ain't puttin up with this dang basement any longer!

Dave	103	 I oughtta give that real estate agent a call.
Dave	118	It's broken!

Dave	36	"  It works, but it makes the worst darn noises you've ever dun heard."
